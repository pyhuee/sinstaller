# SInstaller
Hello there, welcome to my software installer, this thing installs some software, such as

1. Github Desktop (from Shiftkey, https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop )
2. Telgram Desktop
3. Spotify
4. Lutris
5. VS Code

# Some thing's that *don't work*, but are in development.

1. Mullvad VPN
2. Discord
3. Steam
4. Minecraft
5. Microsoft Edge (Yes, I know not open source, it's just what I use.)

# Well, why don't they work?

Well, I'm a n00b, so basically, I just have Github Desktop, and Lutris, install from their added repos, and the rest of the working installers come from SnapCraft. I'm still trying to get those working. They successfully retreive the files, but don't install them due to apt not knowing where to find them.
