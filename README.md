# sinstaller
I made a software install script for Ubuntu. It automatically downloads Mullvad, Discord, Steam, Lutris, Minecraft, Microsoft Edge, Spotify, Minecraft, Telegram, and VS Code. Mostly based on downloading files for you and just using apt. It uses some snaps. Telegram, Spotify, and VS Code come from SnapCraft. I know Microsoft Edge throws a fit for not having a key. Will fix later.
